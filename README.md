# Code-Refactor-w-Readme

To begin the project i began by inspecting the code and seeing how i could improve the code.First i went to the title and changed it to the name we discussed in class.What i did next was i began to insert header tags and replace the div tags. Next i propery placed the headers in sequential order from h1 to h6.Then i added the img alt under the image sources in order to give the image an alternative in case the photo failed to load. Finally i made sure the code was complete ensuring all tags were closed and were in correct order. I endured many struggles such a finding a proper order however i refered to my notes and i found a way to succeed.
